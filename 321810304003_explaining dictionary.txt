What is dictionary in Python? Explain with an example 

:-A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.

Ex:

Create and print a dictionary:
d={'a':1,'b':2,'c':3}
Print(d)

Here d is Dictionary
a,b,c are keys in dictionary
1,2,3 are values in dictionary

Accessing items:

You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets:

Ex:

Get the value of the 'a' key:

x = thisdict['a']

There is also a method called get() that will give you the same result:

Ex:

Get the value of the 'a' key:

x = thisdict.get('a')

Change Values:

You can change the value of a specific item by referring to its key name:

Ex:

Change the 'a'  to 4:

d={'a':1,'b':2,'c':3}
d['a']=4

Check if key exits:

To determine if a specified key is present in a dictionary use the in keyword:
 
prg:

d={'a':1,'b':2,'c':3}
if 'a' in d:
  print("Yes, 'a' is one of the keys in the d dictionary")
